[GSoC 2015](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015) application
period just got over couple of days ago. I received at least 3 requests asking
me for my previous proposals. This made me realise, that even though
they were always publicly available on Google-melange, the way melange works
makes such public proposals almost un-discoverable and probably un-indexable
too.

Most of my proposals were written using Google Docs, since it makes life
easy for the mentors to track changes and comment. But they are still un-discoverable
in this form.

I decided to create a repository porting all my previous proposals to markdown.
`pandoc` has turned out to be really powerful. I didnâ€™t want to just host my 
own proposals so I tried keeping the format very generic. I sent out couple
of emails to past GSoC participants asking them if they would like to push theirs too.

I hope this grows into one powerful archive:
