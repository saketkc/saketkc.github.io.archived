I am a third year PhD student studying Computational Biology and
Bioinformatics at [University of Southern California](http://www.usc.edu).
I am trying to decode gene regulation. Of course, [in the light of evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_in_Biology_Makes_Sense_Except_in_the_Light_of_Evolution)

I am more active on my Math Blog, [Piddling-Pertinent](http://saket-choudhary.me/pertinent-blog)

At some point of time I started writing solutions to Mathematics Department's [Screening Solutions](http://www.saket-choudhary.me/math-screening-solutions/)

I spent the most wonderful years of my life(ever!) at [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in)
graduating with a Bachelors and Masters degree in Chemical Engineering.
